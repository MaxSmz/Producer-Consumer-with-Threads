1. Introduction
One thread, the producer, will generate a sequence of integers and write them in order to successive buffer cells. Several consumer threads will then read these integers from the buffer and print them out in the order read. The is a circular buffer shared between the producer and consumers.
2.  The task of this project is that it will need to create a single producer thread that produces a stream of integers and writes them into a circular buffer, and several consumer threads that read the integers from the buffer and print them to stdout.
The producer thread should produce integers until the buffer is full; then, it will wait until the consumers remove some entries from the buffer. The producer should continue to create integers until it reaches a maximum specified on the command line, then it should exit.
The consumer threads should consume integers from the buffer until it is empty, then wait for the producer to put more integers into the buffer. The consumers should continue to remove integers from the buffer until they have removed and printed all of them; then, they should exit.
Note that this project requires several shared variables and data structures: the buffer, input and output locations, and counts of integers produced and consumed.
